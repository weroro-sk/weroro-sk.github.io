## 🔬 Specialization: Extreme Data Optimization

My core expertise lies in achieving **high-to-extreme data optimization** for web applications, with the goal of
reducing the final bundle size to the absolute minimum.

I am the developer of the **PI-API** programming technique, designed to significantly optimize the minification process
for JS/TS application bundles. This technique is primarily leveraged with minifiers like **Terser**, but is designed to
ensure robust compatibility across various industry minification tools.

I have practical experience with virtually all major, and many exotic, Frontend frameworks.
